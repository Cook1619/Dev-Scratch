  Understand the Problem
  ? Can you restate the problem in your own words?
  ? What are the inputs that go into the problem?
  ? What are the outputs? What should it look like?
  ? Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?  You may not be able to answer this immediately 
  ? How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?

/*
  Exploring Examples
  ? Start with simple examples
  ? Progress to more complex examples
  ? Explore examples with empty inputs
  ? Explore examples with invalid inputs

/*
  Break it down!
  ? Write down the steps you wanna take, could be small little notes for the path you wanna take
  ? Write the skeleton of your function and write pseudo code steps to take in there

// ! Sample
// TODO: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in a string
/*
    Return an object, only care about alpha numeric characters, ignore spaces
*/

function charCount(str) {
  // make an object to return
  // loop over string, for each character
  // if the char is a num/letter and is a key in object, add one to count
  // if the char is a num/letter and is NOT a key in object, add it and set value to one
  // if char is something else (space, period, etc) don't do anything
  // return object
}
