How would you design the system to handle high availability and fault tolerance?
 **Kafka Configuration:**
   - Configure Kafka with a high replication factor (e.g., 3) to ensure that data is not lost if a broker fails.
   - Deploy multiple Kafka brokers across different availability zones to ensure resilience against zone failures.
2. **Service Redundancy:**
   - Deploy multiple instances of the Order Service and Order Processing Service behind a load balancer. Use container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to manage service instances and ensure they are restarted upon failure.
3. **Database Configuration:**
   - Use a distributed database like Cassandra or a highly available relational database cluster with replication across multiple nodes and availability zones.
   - Ensure that the database has automated backup and restore procedures.
4. **Load Balancing:**
   - Use load balancers to distribute incoming API requests across multiple instances of the Order Service.
   - Use Kafkaâ€™s built-in partitioning and consumer group mechanisms to balance the load among multiple instances of the Order Processing Service.
5. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement monitoring for Kafka brokers, ZooKeeper (if used), REST API services, and the database using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
   - Set up alerts for critical metrics such as broker failures, high latency, unprocessed Kafka messages, and service downtimes


   - I'm interested in this team because it seems very backend heavy and I'm excited for the opportunity to work in a more BE role. I know and understand a lot of the theory behind the topics were going to discuss today, but until you have fully implemented it you can never fully understand it. Kafka seems like a fantastic way to do a whole lot of things, and I'm excited top learn and grow in this area of software development
