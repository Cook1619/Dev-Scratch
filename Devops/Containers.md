# Docker/Containerization


## VM VS Container
- Containers offer isolation not virtualization
- Containers are OS "virtualization"
- VMS are hardware virtualization
- VM needs OS
- Containers don't need OS
- Containers uses Host OS for compute resource

# Docker
- Manages your containers
- Docker created an industry standard for containers, so there portable anywhere
- Lightweight: Containers share the machines OS system kernel and there do not require an OS per application, driving higher server efficiencies and reducing server and licensing cost
- Secure: Applications are safer in containers and Docker provides the strongest default isolation capabilities in the industry
