 What is devops? 
 - DevOps is a term that combines "development" and "operations" and refers to a set of practices, methodologies, and cultural philosophies aimed at improving collaboration and efficiency between software development teams and IT operations teams. It promotes a culture of shared responsibility, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and automation to deliver high-quality software products more rapidly and reliably.

 - Traditionally, development and operations teams have operated in separate silos, leading to communication gaps, delays, and inefficiencies. DevOps seeks to bridge this gap by fostering close collaboration, communication, and integration between these teams throughout the entire software development lifecycle.

 - Key principles and practices of DevOps include:

 - Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): DevOps emphasizes automating the build, testing, and deployment processes to enable frequent and reliable software releases. This involves using tools and practices to continuously integrate code changes, run automated tests, and deploy applications to production environments.

 - Infrastructure as Code (IaC): DevOps encourages the use of declarative, version-controlled templates to define and manage infrastructure resources such as servers, networks, and databases. This allows for consistent and reproducible deployments and enables the automation of infrastructure provisioning and configuration.

 - Configuration Management: DevOps employs tools and practices to manage and automate the configuration of software and infrastructure components. This ensures that environments are consistent and reduces the risk of configuration-related issues when deploying applications.

 - Monitoring and Logging: DevOps advocates for the use of monitoring and logging tools to gain visibility into the performance and health of software systems. This helps identify issues, track system behavior, and enable proactive response to incidents.

 - Collaboration and Communication: DevOps emphasizes breaking down silos between teams by fostering a culture of collaboration, shared goals, and effective communication. This includes encouraging cross-functional teams, promoting knowledge sharing, and using collaborative tools.

 - Overall, the goal of DevOps is to enable organizations to deliver software more frequently, reliably, and with improved quality. By bringing development and operations teams together and leveraging automation and best practices, DevOps helps organizations streamline their software delivery processes and adapt to the demands of modern software development
