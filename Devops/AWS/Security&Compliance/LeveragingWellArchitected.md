# Leveraging Well-Architected Framework
### 6 Pillars
- Operational Excellence (AWS Code Commit)
  - The pillar for creating applications that effectively support production workloads
  - Plan for and anticipate failure
  - Deploy smaller, reversible changes
  - Script operations as code
  - Learn from failure and refine
- Security (Cloudtrail)
  - Putting mechanisms in place to help protect your systems and data
  - Automate security tasks
  - Assign only the least privileges required
  - Encrypt data in transit and at rest
  - Track who did what and when (CloudTrail)
  - Ensure security at all application layers
- Reliability (RDS Multi AZ deployments)
  - Focuses on designing systems that work consistently and recover quickly
  - Recover from failure automatically
  - Scale horizontally for resilience
  - Stop guessing capacity
  - Manage chance through automation
  - Test recovery procedures
- Performance Efficiency (AWS Lamda zero admin)
  - Focuses on the effective use of computing resources to meet system and business requirements while removing bottlenecks
  - Use serverless architecture first
  - Use multi-region deployments
  - Delegate tasks to a cloud vendor
  - Experiment with virtual resources
- Cost Optimization (S3 intelligent tiering)
  - Focuses on delivering optimum and resilient solutions at the east cost to the user
  - Utilize consumption based pricing
  - Implement cloud financial management
  - Measure overall efficiency 
  - Pay only for resources your application requires
- Sustainability (EC@ auto scaling)
  - Focuses on env impacts, especially energy consumption and efficiency
  - Understand your impact
  - Establish sustainability goals
  - Maximize utilization
  - Use managed services
  - Reduce downstream impact
