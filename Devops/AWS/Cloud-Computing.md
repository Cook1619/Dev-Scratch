# Cloud Computing
- The cloud is a real place where your data is stored somewhere
- Servers are powerful computers that handle your requests
- Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet
  - Compute 
    - EC2
    - Lamda
  - Networking
    - VPC
    - Direct Connect
  - Storage
    - S3
    - EBS
  - Analytics
    - Athena
    - Redshift
  - Development
    - Cloud9
    - CodeCommit
  - Security
    - IAM
    - Macie
  - Databases
    - RDS
    - DynamoDB
- Virtual Machines
  - Virtualization lets you divide hardware resources on a single physical server into smaller units
  - Usage, your usage is placed on a meter, you only pay when you access it and only for what you use
    - On demand - No long term commitments or upfront payments
    - Pay as you go - Pay by the hours or the second for only what you use
## Advantages of cloud computing
  - Go global in minutes
    - You can deploy your applications around the world at the click of a button.
  - Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
    - You can focus on building your applications instead of managing hardware.
  - Increase speed and agility
    - The provided services allow you to innovate more quickly and deliver your applications faster.
  - Stop guessing capacity
    - Your capacity is matched exactly to your demand.
  - Trade capital expense for variable expense
    - You pay for what you use instead of making huge upfront investments. 
## CapEx vs OpEx
- Capital Expenditures
  - Capital expenditures are upfront purchases toward fixed assets.
- Operating Expenses
  - Operating expenses are funds used to run day-to-day operations.
## Cloud Computing Models
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - Building Blocks 
    - Fundamental building blocks that can be rented. 
  - Web Hosting 
    - Monthly subscription to have a hosting company serve your website
- Software as a service (SaaS)
    - Using a complete application, on demand, that someone offers to users.
  - Email Provider
    - Your personal email that you access through a web browser is a SaasS
  - Platform as a service (PaaS)
    - Used by developers
      - Developer software using web based tools without worrying about the underlying infrastructure
    - Storefront Website
      - Tools provided to build a storefront app that runs on another company's service
## Cloud Deployment models
- Private cloud
  - Also called on prem
  - Exists in your internal data center
  - Doesn't offer the advantages of cloud computing
- Public cloud
  - Offered by AWS
  - You aren't responsible for the physical hardware
  - Provides all the advantages of cloud computing
- Hybrid (a combination between the 2)
  - Highly sensitive data stored locally
  - Web app runs on aws infrastructure
  - AWS provides tools so they talk to each other
