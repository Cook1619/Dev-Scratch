# EC2
- Elastic Compute Cloud
    - EC2 allows you to rent and manage virtual servers in the cloud
    - Servers are the physical compute hardware running in a data center
    - EC2 instances are the virtual servers running on these physical servers
    - Instances are not considered serverless
    - EC2 is a foundational service used for managing your virtual instances
    - You are able to provision an ec2 instance at the click of a button
    - You can use a preconfigured template called an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to launch your instance
    - You can deploy your applications directly to ec2 instances
    - You receive 750 compute hours per month on the free tier plan

## When would you want to use an ec2 instance???
 - Deploy a database
    - Deploying a database to an EC2 gives you full control over the DB
 - Deploy a web application
    - Deploy to multiple AZ's to make the web application highly available
## How to access your ec2 instance
 - AWS management console
    - You're able to configure and manage your instances via a web browser
 - Secure Shell (SSH)
    - SSH allows you to establish a secure connection to your instance from your local laptop
 - EC2 instance connect (EIC)
    - EIC allows you to use IAM policies to control the SSH access to your instances, removing the need to manage SSH keys
 - AWS systems manager
    - Systems manager allows you to manage your EC2 instances via web browser or the aws cli
 - The most common way to connect to he linux ec2 instances is via SSH
    - Generate a key pair
       - a key pair which consists of a private key and a public key, proves your identity when connecting to an EC2 instance
    - Connect SSH
        - User -> SSH client on laptop (uses private key) -> EC2 instance (uses public key)
    - Several pricing options
        - On demand - fixed price in which you are billed down to the second
            - You care about low cost without and without any upfront payment or long term commitment
            - Applications have unpredictable workloads that can't be interrupted
            - You app in under development
            - Your workloads will not run longer then a year
        - Spot - let you take advantage of unused ec2 capacity. Your request is fulfilled only if capacity is available (Cheapest option)
            - Your not concerned about the start or stop time of your app
            - Your workloads can be interrupted
            - You app is only feasible at very low compute prices
        - Reserved instances - RLS allow you to commit to a specific instance type in a particular region for 1 or 3 years
            - Your app has a steady state usage, and you can commit to 1 or 3 years
            - You can pay money upfront in order to receive a discount on On-Demand prices
            - You app requires capacity reservation
        - Dedicated hosts - allow you to pay for a physical server that is fully dedicated to running your instances
            - You want to bring your own server-bound software license from vendors like microsoft or oracle
            - You have regulatory or corporate compliance reqs around tenancy model
        - Savings plans - allow you to commit to compute usage (measured per hour)
            - You want to lower your bill across multiple compute services
            - You want the flexibility to chance compute services, instance types, operating systems, or regions
 - Elastic load balancing
    - ELB - automatically distributes your incoming app traffic across multiple ec2 instances
 - EC2 Auto Scaling
    - EC2 auto scaling adds or removes ec2 instances automatically across AZ's, based on the need and changing demand
