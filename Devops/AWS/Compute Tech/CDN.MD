# Content Delivery
- What is a CDN?
  - Is a mechanism to deliver content quickly and efficiently based opn geographical location
  - CDN's offer low latency
- Amazon Cloudfront
  - Is a CDN that delivers data and applications globally with low latency
  - Makes content available globally or restricts based on location
  - Speeds up delivery of static (all files served on client) or dynamic web content
  - Uses edge locations to cache content (this is how is speeds delivery)
  - Cache is just a copy of a file
  - If content is already at an edge location CloudFront delivers it immediately, if not the CloudFront retrieves the files from the origin
  - Users request data -> Goes to Cloudfront distribution (collection of edge locations (edge locations are a mini data center where files are cached)) sees if its there and sends back immediately-> then sends request to the origin(original source of content) (could be s3 bucket, ec2 instance etc.)
  - CloudFront has security features like DDoS protection and geo-restriction
- Global Accelerator
  - Sends your users through the AWS global network when accessing your content, speeding up delivery
  - improves latency and availability of a single region applications
  - sends traffic through the AWS global network infrastructure
  - 60% performance boost
  - Auto re-routes traffic to healthy available regional endpoints
- Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration
  - Improves content uploads and downloads to and from s3 buckets
  - faster transfer of files over long distances
  - Uses CloudFront globally distributed edge locations
  - Customers around the world can upload to a central bucket
