# S3 (simple storage service)
- The big picture
  - Companies need to collect, store, and analyze data they've accumulated over the years on a massive scale. Storage services in the cloud provide a place for companies to store data.
- S3 is an object storage service for the cloud that is highly available
  - Objects (files) are stored in buckets (directories)
  - Essentially unlimited storage that be held in millions of objects per bucket
  - Object can be public or private
  - You can upload objects via the console, the CLI, or programmatically from within the code using SDKs
- You can set security at the bucket level or individual object level using access control lists (ACLs), bucket policies, or access point policies
- You can enable versioning to create multiple versions of your file in order to protect against accidental deletion and to use a previous version
- You can use S3 access logs to track the access to your buckets and objects
- S3 is a regional service, the bucket names must be globally unique

# Data Accessibility
- Durability and availability are 2 very different aspects of data accessibility
  - Durability - Is important so your objects are never lost of compromised
  - Availability - is important, so you can access your data quickly when you need it
  - They can have 99.99 avail and dura because these objects are replicated across multiple servers per region, but you can also set up cross region replication as well

  - S3 standard - general purpose storage, frequently accessed data
  - S3 Intelligent-tiering - Automatically moves your data to the most cost-effective storage , Data with unknown or changing access pattern
  - S3 Standard infrequent access (IA) - Data accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when you need it - long-lived data
  - S3 One Zone Infrequent Access
  - S3 Glacier
  - S3 Glacier Deep Archive - cheapest of all data options - long term data archives
  - S3 Outposts - on prem storage
- S3 is used for:
  - Static websites
  - Data archive
  - Analytics systems - store data in amazon s3 for use with analytics services like redshift and athena
