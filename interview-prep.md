## üèóÔ∏è System Design Discussion Topics

### **1. API Design Decisions**
**Question**: "How do you decide between REST and GraphQL?"

**Your Answer Framework**:
- **REST when**: Simple CRUD, caching important, well-defined endpoints
- **GraphQL when**: Complex data relationships, multiple client types, over/under-fetching issues
- **Real experience**: "At Mastery Logistics, we chose GraphQL for our logistics platform because we had both mobile and web clients consuming the same data. GraphQL allowed us to maintain a single API that each client could query for exactly the data they needed - preventing over-fetching on mobile and under-fetching on web, while eliminating the need to build and maintain separate endpoints for different client requirements."

### **2. Event-Driven Architecture**
**Question**: "When would you use message queues vs direct API calls?"

**Your Answer Framework**:
- **Message Queues (Kafka/SQS)**: Decoupling, reliability, handling traffic spikes
- **Direct APIs**: Real-time responses, simple request/response patterns
- **Real experience**: "We implemented SQS for... because we needed to handle..."

### **3. Legacy System Migration**
**Question**: "How do you approach migrating legacy systems?"

**Your Answer Framework**:
- **Assessment phase**: Performance bottlenecks, maintenance costs
- **Migration strategy**: Incremental vs big-bang approach
- **Risk mitigation**: Parallel running, rollback plans, testing
- **Real experience**: "When migrating ColdFusion to Node.js at Shippers Edge, we first analyzed our existing query patterns and identified significant redundancies. We discovered that many of our CF endpoints were running similar queries with slight variations. Our Node.js migration strategy focused on creating more versatile endpoints that could handle multiple query scenarios through dynamic parameters - similar to how ColdFusion's native query flexibility worked, but with better performance. By consolidating these patterns into a unified Node.js API layer, we eliminated redundant database calls and implemented intelligent query batching and optimization, which significantly improved both performance and maintainability."

### **4. Testing Strategy**
**Question**: "How do you ensure code quality in a fast-paced environment?"

**Your Answer Framework**:
- **Multi-layer testing**: Unit (Jasmine), E2E (Cypress), integration
- **Code review process**: Pull requests, standards enforcement
- **CI/CD integration**: Automated testing pipelines
- **Real experience**: "At Shippers Edge, we integrated Cypress..."

## üí° Detailed Answer Examples

### **Architecture & Design Questions**

**Q: "Tell me about a time you had to make a trade-off between performance and maintainability"**

**Your Answer**: "During the ColdFusion to Node.js migration at Shippers Edge, we faced exactly this trade-off. We could have done a direct 1:1 port of each CF endpoint to Node.js for speed, but that would have carried forward all the query redundancies and maintenance issues. Instead, we chose to invest more time upfront in analyzing query patterns and building more flexible, parameterized endpoints. This took longer initially, but the result was a much more maintainable codebase with significantly better performance through query consolidation and batching. The trade-off was worth it - we reduced our endpoint count by about 40% while improving response times."

**Q: "How do you handle error handling in distributed systems?"**

**Your Answer**: "From my experience with Kafka and SQS implementations, I've learned that error handling in distributed systems requires multiple layers. First, implement circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures when services are down. Second, use dead letter queues for messages that fail processing - this lets you retry later or investigate issues without blocking the main flow. Third, ensure proper logging and monitoring so you can trace errors across service boundaries. At Brooksource, when we implemented SQS for event-driven architecture, we built in retry logic with exponential backoff and comprehensive error logging that helped us quickly identify and resolve issues."

**Q: "What's your approach to API versioning?"**

**Your Answer**: "I believe in semantic versioning with backward compatibility as the priority. When we migrated APIs at Shippers Edge, we maintained both old and new endpoints during transition periods. For breaking changes, I prefer URL versioning (v1, v2) because it's explicit and easy for client teams to understand. For non-breaking changes, we can evolve the same version. The key is clear communication with consuming teams and deprecation timelines. GraphQL actually helps here because clients specify exactly what they need, so you can add fields without breaking existing queries."

### **Performance & Scalability Questions**

**Q: "How would you optimize a slow API endpoint?"**

**Your Answer**: "I start with measurement - profiling to identify if the bottleneck is database queries, external API calls, or computation. At Shippers Edge, we had slow carrier rate APIs, so we implemented caching for frequently requested routes and moved non-urgent rate requests to SQS for async processing. For database bottlenecks, I look at query optimization, indexing, and whether we're doing N+1 queries that could be batched. The ColdFusion migration actually gave us a perfect example - by consolidating similar queries with parameters, we reduced database roundtrips significantly."

**Q: "What caching strategies have you implemented?"**

**Your Answer**: "I've used different caching strategies depending on the use case. For the shipping rate calculator, we used Redis to cache frequently requested routes since shipping costs don't change often throughout the day. For GraphQL endpoints, we implemented query-level caching based on the specific fields requested. I also believe in CDN caching for static assets and API responses that don't change frequently. The key is understanding your data's freshness requirements and cache invalidation strategy."

**Q: "How do you handle high-traffic scenarios?"**

**Your Answer**: "My approach combines several strategies: First, implement proper load balancing and horizontal scaling. Second, use asynchronous processing for non-critical operations - SQS has been great for this. Third, implement circuit breakers and rate limiting to prevent system overload. At Mastery Logistics, we used Kafka for high-throughput event processing, which let us handle traffic spikes without blocking the main application flow. Database connection pooling and query optimization are also crucial for maintaining performance under load."

### **Team & Process Questions**

**Q: "How do you approach code reviews?"**

**Your Answer**: "I see code reviews as both quality gates and learning opportunities. I look for functionality, readability, performance implications, and security concerns. But I also try to understand the problem-solving approach and share knowledge. At Brooksource, I helped establish our code review standards as part of redefining our Definition of Done. I believe in constructive feedback - explaining not just what should change, but why. I also encourage reviewing smaller, focused PRs rather than large changes that are harder to review thoroughly."

**Q: "Tell me about a time you improved team processes"**

**Your Answer**: "At Brooksource, our team was struggling with inconsistent delivery quality and unclear completion criteria. I took the initiative to redefine our 'Definition of Done' by facilitating workshops with the team to identify what 'complete' really meant for different types of work. We created checklists for features, bug fixes, and technical debt work. I also founded a weekly knowledge-sharing session where engineers could present new technologies or solutions to problems. The result was more consistent deliveries and faster team learning. Our sprint velocity improved because we had fewer back-and-forth iterations on what constituted finished work."

**Q: "How do you handle technical disagreements?"**

**Your Answer**: "I approach technical disagreements as problem-solving opportunities rather than conflicts. First, I try to understand the other perspective fully - often there are valid concerns I hadn't considered. Then I like to focus on objective criteria: performance implications, maintainability, security, and business requirements. If possible, I suggest creating small proofs of concept to test different approaches. During the ColdFusion migration discussions, we had debates about migration strategy - big bang vs incremental. By analyzing risk factors and creating small test migrations, we could make data-driven decisions rather than arguing based on opinions. The key is keeping the focus on finding the best solution for the business and users."
