### **2. Event-Driven Architecture**
**Question**: "When would you use message queues vs direct API calls?"

**Your Answer Framework**:
- **Message Queues (Kafka/SQS)**: Decoupling, reliability, handling traffic spikes
- **Direct APIs**: Real-time responses, simple request/response patterns
- **Real experience**: "We implemented SQS for... because we needed to handle..."

### **3. Legacy System Migration**
**Question**: "How do you approach migrating legacy systems?"

**Your Answer Framework**:
- **Assessment phase**: Performance bottlenecks, maintenance costs
- **Migration strategy**: Incremental vs big-bang approach
- **Risk mitigation**: Parallel running, rollback plans, testing
- **Real experience**: "When migrating ColdFusion to Node.js, we..."

### **4. Testing Strategy**
**Question**: "How do you ensure code quality in a fast-paced environment?"

**Your Answer Framework**:
- **Multi-layer testing**: Unit (Jasmine), E2E (Cypress), integration
- **Code review process**: Pull requests, standards enforcement

## üí≠ System Design Scenarios to Practice

### **Scenario 1: Real-time Shipping Rate Calculator**
*"Design a system that provides real-time shipping rates from multiple carriers"*

**Your approach**:
- **API Gateway**: Route requests to appropriate carrier APIs
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently requested routes
- **Async Processing**: SQS for rate requests that can be delayed
- **Fallback Strategy**: Default rates when carriers are down

### **Scenario 2: Event-Driven Order Processing**
*"Design a system to process orders across multiple services"*

**Your approach**:
- **Event Bus**: Kafka for order events (created, updated, shipped)
- **Service Boundaries**: Order service, inventory service, notification service
- **Data Consistency**: Event sourcing vs distributed transactions
- **Error Handling**: Dead letter queues, retry mechanisms

### **Scenario 3: Legacy System Integration**
*"How would you integrate a new React frontend with legacy backend systems?"*

**Your approach**:
- **API Facade**: Modern REST/GraphQL layer over legacy systems
- **Data Transformation**: Normalize legacy data formats
- **Incremental Migration**: Feature-by-feature replacement
- **Monitoring**: Track performance and error rates during transition
